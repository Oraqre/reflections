When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Having a local repository should be my first choice. Maybe sometimes I don't get my
  computer around, I have to use the repository. Or the computer I'm using is beyond 
  my control, I don't want to the owner have control to or find out my project.
